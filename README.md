# Hello there 👋🏾
I’m Kamili Dawud, but you can call me Kata, which means "form." I am a former Visual Communications major and have since gained 10 years of experience in marketing, merchandising, and coordinating live productions. My passion for VCOM has allowed me to work across various industries and fields throughout my career.

More recently, I decided to venture into the tech world and earned my certification in UX/UI Design. So far, my favorite aspects of the Double Diamond process are Empathy Mapping and User Persons. I thrive in both self-directed and team-oriented environments and am eager to continue expanding my knowledge, experience, and network in git.

I’m dedicated to creating engaging and visually appealing experiences in a dynamic way. Follow & join me on my journey, Watch[Me]Thrive, and feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating! 🌱
